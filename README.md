I made an organizer to test a logic on how to make an inventory. I've used Xaml, and C# for this project. 

The first page has 3 options: Organize, Load File, and Quit. Organize takes you to the inventory system. Load File makes you open your file 
explorer so you can search for your saved files. Once you open your file, it takes you to the Inventory screen with all of your boxes stored. Quit
just exits the program, of course! Nothing too fancy, I prefer doing things simple.

# Inventory
This screen is where the logic is being placed. This is how it should look if you have clicked on the organize button or you have not added any
boxes in your loaded file. There is a back button that can get you back to the title screen and there is a plus button that can get you to add,
edit, and make your box.

This is how it should theoretically look if you added anything. See how there are different colors and names in each box that were implemented. This can happen because of the edit made in Box Maker, which I will explain how it is used.

# Box Maker
The Box Maker gives you the option to name your new box and apply some color to it. There are a lot of options in what you can do with, so 
have fun with it!
